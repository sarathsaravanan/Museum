                <p class="bio">
                    As the survivor of the original "Bloodbath," Dr. Riot is the foremost expert on the history of extreme difficulty. He spent years excavating the ruins of the 1.9 Era, recovering artifacts that were once thought to be physically impossible for humans to touch. His excavation style is aggressive and persistent; he is known for attempting a single extraction over 30,000 times until he succeeds. He founded the museum's "Hell Wing" to ensure that the sacrifices of the early demon slayers are never forgotten.

                <p class="expertise"><strong>Specialty:</strong> Collaborative Sociology & Megacollabs</p>
                <p class="bio">
                    Professor Viprin studies the "Creators"—the ancient beings who built these digital torture devices. Unlike others who study the levels, Viprin studies the *people*. He is fascinated by the phenomenon of "Megacollabs," where dozens of creators unite to build a single massive structure. He has mapped the social hierarchies of the Update 2.1 civilizations and currently leads the "Copy & Paste" research division. His work helps us understand how a chaotic group of creators can form a cohesive society.

                <p class="bio">
                    While the others gather data, Agent Colon explains what it *means*. He is a "Culturalist" who obsessively analyzes the placement of every spike and sawblade to find hidden meanings. He is famous for his 40-page dissertations on why a single object in a level is "slightly misaligned." Colon believes that bad gameplay is not just a mistake, but a moral failing of the creator. He translates the abstract chaos of the Demonlist into stories that the public can understand (and critique).
